The natural areas inventory using a manual interpretation of 1989 color infrared aerial photography (approximate data coverage: inside the Metro boundary). See Green Spaces Master Plan. Used the modified USGS Anderson level II classification.2. Remotely sensed data; thematic mapper imagery, 1989-90 (approximate data coverage: outside the Metro boundary).]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["Metro Data Resource Center"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library â€“ UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Polygon data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Biology"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["1991"],"dct_issued_s": "2001","gbl_indexYear_im": [1991],"dct_spatial_sm": ["Portland Metro","Oregon"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-122.101637, -123.509318, 45.893371, 45.095614)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-123.509318, -122.101637, 45.893371, 45.095614)","dct_rights_sm": ["<a href=\"https://uwm.edu/libraries/digital-collections/copyright-digcoll/\">Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digital Collections</a>.","Although this data is being distributed by the American Geographical Society Library at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Libraries, no warranty expressed or implied is made by the University as to the accuracy of the data and related materials.
