The dataset was originally published by the Great Lakes Information Network on November 8, 2006.[A bathymetric layer for Lake ErieNOAA is engaged in a program to compile Great Lakes bathymetric data and make them readily available to the public, especially to the communities concerned with Great Lakes science, pollution, coastal erosion, response to climate changes, threats to lake ecosystems, and health of the fishing industry. This program is managed by NGDC and it relies on the cooperation of NOAA/Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, NOAA/National Ocean Service, the Canadian Hydrographic Service, other agencies, and academic laboratories.Compilation of new bathymetry for the Great Lakes is an important part of this program, being carried out cooperatively between NOAA (NGDC and GLERL), and the Canadian Hydrographic Service. This new bathymetry provides a more detailed portrayal of lakefloor topography, and reveals some lakefloor features seen for the first time.]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["Great Lakes Information Network"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library â€“ UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Line data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Elevation"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["2006-11-08"],"dct_issued_s": "2006","gbl_indexYear_im": [2006],"dct_spatial_sm": ["Lake Erie","United States","Canada"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-78.7695, -83.57167, 42.910304, 41.363586)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-83.57167, -78.7695, 42.910304, 41.363586)","dct_rights_sm": ["Please see UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digital Collections.","Although this data is being distributed by the American Geographical Society Library at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Libraries, no warranty expressed or implied is made by the University as to the accuracy of the data and related materials.
