Each first water contour dataset was created using the contour function in ArcGIS Spatial Analyst, version 8.3.][Groundwater Inventory and Mapping Project, a cooperative effort between the Water Bureau - Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, USGS - Michigan Water Science Center and Michigan State University - Institute of Water Research, RS&amp;GIS and Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering.
